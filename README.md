# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of short notes on things I learn across various languages and technologies. These are short notes that don't warrant a full blog post. In keeping the notes short it will reduce the barrier of entry to write these more often.

## About

I stole this from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). I recently came across his [blog post](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9) to describe his habit of writing and learning that is small enough to stick to.
